## Fast Hamiltonian Simulation

The problem of efficiently simulating a Hamiltonian is one of the long standing problems in computational physics. Today, the problem of Hamiltonian simulation stands as one of the most impacting and significant contribution of quantum computers. Furthermore since it is a BQP-complete problem, devising any efficient classical algorithm for the same is believed to be intractable.

Here, we plan to implement the following algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation:
- [] Trotterization
- [] Quantum Signal Processing
- [] Quantum Walks
- [] Qubitization
- [] Quantum Singular Value Transformation
